1. Java
Java is a class-based, OOP language developed by Sun Mycrosystems in the 1990s. It's standardly used for web-based content, mobile apps and games and the Android operating system.
Java is similar to C# due to their object-oriented core.
They differ though because of Java's usage. While C# is used mostly for desktop games and apps, Java's usage is on web-based content.

2. C Language

C is mostly used for implementing operating systems and embedded applications. The C Programming Language itself provides the core(foundation) of many other languages it's advisable to learn C and C++ before moving onto C# and etc.

C is quite similar to C#. Ex. Hello World in C would look something like this :

#include<studio.h>

main()

{
	printf("Hello World");

}

so yeah. you get the point.
The difference is that C# is much more powerful and functional. There are many, many, many functions in C# that you have to create yourself which is pretty damn hard. C# is also a lot "younger" than his older bro.

3. Objective-C

Objective-C is also a OOP language although it's used only used by Apple's OS. It powers Apple's OSX and IOS. Same goes for APIs and can be used to create
iPhone apps.
Although C is the name too, Objective-C is quite outdated and different compared to C#. The syntax is absolutely different with almost no similarities
except some keywords like int,main or return.
The similarities are that C# and Objective - C are both OOP languages. Their usage is quite the same also. They are used for creating applications and software.




4. PHP 

PHP (Hypertext Processor) is a free, server-side scripting language designed for dynamic websites and app development. It can be directly embedded into an HTML source document rather than an external file, which has made it a popular programming language for web developers. PHP powers more than 200 million websites, including Wordpress, Di
gg and Facebook.
